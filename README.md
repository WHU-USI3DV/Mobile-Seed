## ðŸ”­ Introduction
<p align="center">
<strong>TL;DR: Mobile-Seed is an online framework for simultaneous semantic segmentation
and boundary detection on compact robots.</strong>

<p align="justify">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries
and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream
robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, realtime semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection
and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most
studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In
this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task
framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation
and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream
encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways:
one captures category-aware semantic information, while the
other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD
module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore,
we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in
dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to
existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight
framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation
performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed
achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp
in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of
23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024Ã—2048 resolution input
on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on CamVid
and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our methodâ€™s generalizability.

Our Mobile-Seed is built on [MMsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) 0.29.1. Please refer to the [installation](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/0.x/get_started.html#installation) page  for more details.
A quick installation example: 
```
conda create --name mobileseed python=3.7 -y
conda activate mobileseed
pip install -r requirements.txt
mim install mmengine
mim install mmcv-full
git clone https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/Mobile-Seed.git
cd Mobile-Seed
pip install -v -e .
```

## ðŸš… Usage
### Evaluation
**NOTE: data preprocssing is not necessary for evaluation.**
We provide pre-trained models for Cityscapes, CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets. Please download the weights from [onedrive](https://whueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/martin_liao_whu_edu_cn/EoHdpcPhhUJIkKpKUCKRdqIBMTjgvR1lh2nNzS_WeGKCaw?e=k7q3yR) or [Baidu-disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aJhLipP0UuMehInJdlGF7g) (code:MS24) and put them in a folder like ```ckpt/```. We will release our re-trained AFFormer-T weights on the Cityscapes, Camvid and PASCAL Context datasets for reference in the near future.
Example: evaluate  ```Mobile-Seed``` on  ```Cityscapes```:
```
# Single-gpu testing
bash tools/dist_test.sh ./configs/Mobile_Seed/MS_tiny_cityscapes.py /path/to/checkpoint_file.pth 1 --eval mIoU
```

- Mobile-Seed Performance:

|      Dataset    | mIoU | mBIoU (3px) |FLOPs|
|:----------------:|:------------------:|:----------:|:----:|
| Cityscapes  | 78.4    | 43.3 | 31.6G |
| CamVid  |   73.4 | 45.2     |  4.1G  |
| PASCAL Context (60)   |  47.2 | 22.1     | 3.7G |
| PASCAL Context (59)  |   43.0 | 16.2     | 3.7G |

### Training
Download weights of AFFormer pretrained on ImageNet-1K from [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mru24qPdta9o8aLn1RwT8EapiQCih1Sw?usp=share_link) or [alidrive](https://www.aliyundrive.com/s/Ha2xMsG9ufy) and put them in a folder like ```ckpt/```. On the Cityscapes dataset, we trained the Mobile-Seed with an Intel Core i9-13900K CPU and a NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU for 160K iterations and cost approximately 22 hours.
Example: train ```Mobile-Seed``` on ```Cityscapes```:
```
# Single-gpu training
bash tools/dist_train.sh ./configs/Mobile_Seed/MS_tiny_cityscapes.py

# Multi-gpu training
bash tools/dist_train.sh ./configs/Mobile_Seed/MS_tiny_cityscapes.py <GPU_NUM>
```

### Data preprocessing
#### Cityscapes
- Download the files gtFine_trainvaltest.zip, leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip and leftImg8bit_demoVideo.zip from the [Cityscapes website](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) to data_orig/, and unzip them:
```
unzip data_orig/gtFine_trainvaltest.zip -d data_orig && rm data_orig/gtFine_trainvaltest.zip
unzip data_orig/leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip -d data_orig && rm data_orig/leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip
unzip data_orig/leftImg8bit_demoVideo.zip -d data_orig && rm data_orig/leftImg8bit_demoVideo.zip
```
- create training semantic label:
``
python data_preprocess/cityscapes_preprocess/code/createTrainIdLabelImgs.py <data_path>
``
- Generate .png training semantic boundary labels by running the following command:
```
# In Matlab Command Window
run code/demoPreproc_gen_png_label.m
```
This will create **instance-insensitive** semantic boundary labels for network training in ``data_proc_nis/``.

#### CamVid & PASCAL Context
- semantic boundary label generation:
``
python data_preprocess/camvid_pascal_preprocess/label_generator.py <dataset> <data_path> 
``
We split the training and test set of Camvid according to [PIDNet](https://github.com/XuJiacong/PIDNet) to avoid same-area evaluation.
